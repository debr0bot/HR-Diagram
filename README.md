# HR-Diagram
Plotting HR diagram  
Using the data obtained from the M29 cluster, analyze several b and v filter images, to remove the bias and calibrate the images to plot the final diagram.
The HR diagram is a scatter plot of stars showing the relationship between the stars' absolute magnitudes or luminosities versus their stellar classifications or effective temperatures.

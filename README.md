# HR-Diagram
Plotting HR diagram  Using data obtained from the M29 cluster, I analyzed several b and v filter images, to remove the bias and calibrated the images to plot the final diagram, which is a scatter plot of stars showing the relationship between the stars' absolute magnitudes or luminosities versus their stellar classifications or effective temperatures.
